For bug report, please include:

* What you did (the command you run)
* What you observed (the full logs)
* What you expected
* Your environment information

If you're unable to get good accuracy:

1. First, please test on your training set to see if you're using it correctly.
2. Second, note that machine learning does not always work.
	 It highly depends on the size and difficulty of your dataset.
	 The algorithms and parameters in this project are designed to work for our situation,
	 but it may require extra work for it to adopt to your use case.
